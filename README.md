xPLSimulator
============================

xPLSimulator is a free and open-source software.
It allows you to evaluate the xPL traffic through your local network. 
It sniffs and displays the xPL messages that you receive and allows you to send pre-built messages. 

It has been developped to give some help at debugging and security evaluation of local xPL based systems. It should also
be helpfull for developpers that are working on some xPL applications to test the send/receive messages and simulate a xPL
interraction between two or more components.

It is to be compiled with Qt's librairies, and it has been tested and deployed only on Ubuntu and Fedora platforms.
It should work normally on Windows, but not tested yet.


============================

If you discover some bugs, or if you have any issue with working with it or at any step of the compilation/deployment,
can ask your question by contact the developper (jeremy.huleux@zigbus.com).


============================

This software is a beta version. All the functionnalities are'nt implemented yet.
